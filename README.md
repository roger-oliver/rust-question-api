# rust-question-api

My endeavour to learn Rust started a couple of weeks ago and it's been quite interesting.

This project is the first one I created following the book "Rust web development" [https://www.manning.com/books/rust-web-development]. Intersting book that let you build from start to finish a small api, BUT, at the end the project does not fully work as expected.

Here, you can see some differences from the original project that I need to add to make it work as expected. Hope that it can help someone else!
